# 📘  Gamified Parsing Education Evaluation using Quizizz

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores the impact of a **gamified learning model** for teaching complex parsing techniques in computer science, using **Quizizz** as the primary platform for interactive assessment. It is part of an educational research initiative to improve engagement, understanding, and retention of parsing concepts among undergraduate students through game-based learning.

## 🎮 Game-Based Learning Approach

* **Platform Used**: [Quizizz](https://quizizz.com/)
* **Gamification Features Leveraged**:

  * Timed challenges
  * Leaderboards
  * Immediate feedback
  * Progress tracking
* **Targeted Topics**:

  * Top-Down Parsing
  * Bottom-Up Parsing
  * Semantic Parsing
  * Dependency Parsing
  * Chart Parsing

---

## 🧪 Study Design

* **Participants**:

  * 40 undergraduate CS students
  * Divided into **Experimental Group** (used gamified Quizizz model) and **Control Group** (traditional instruction)
* **Methodology**:

  * Pre-Test (15 questions, 30 marks total)
  * Post-Test (15 questions, 30 marks total)
  * Retention Test (1 week later)
  * Engagement Tracking (Quizizz in-game data)
  * 10-item Likert Satisfaction Survey

## 📈 Key Findings (Preliminary)

* Experimental group showed **\~88% increase** in learning gain compared to control.
* Retention scores were **\~38% higher** one week later in gamified learners.
* Engagement metrics (time spent, retries) positively correlated with post-test scores.
* Satisfaction score was **4.3/5**, indicating strong learner motivation and enjoyment.
